title: Near Misses

- First blossom today, taking center court as it 
- floats over the cosmic, kaleidoscopic carp, 

- announcing that all is not lost: the great flame 

- of summer, lights this lily’s blushing cup. 

- His toil was not for nothing – I must tell him that. 

- ~
- The maple, mondo, and sumac each sway and retract,  
- reflecting the moves of his craft and his burden. 

- Tonight, I am lone witness to this lavish 

- scene of a broken heart bending. 

- When I cannot love, he loves the dirt instead. 

- ~
- Greedy brown birds gorge on unripe Rainiers 
- while I light a cigarette, make a toast to the fans 

- of the purple smoke tree, and joke “We are *smoking!”* 

- But no one hears. No one is here. 

- Maybe all great gardens are born from such near misses.
