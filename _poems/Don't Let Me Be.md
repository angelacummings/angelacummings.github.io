title: Don't Let Me Be

---

Don’t let me be just -- 

just a stick whittled and trimmed 

into a disfigured twig. 

Be just instead; look fairly and far 

and further into me. 

 

Don’t let me be -- 

be 'tween too soft, yet hardly soft. 

Let me rather be thickened, be fed 

become another mother to my self. 

 

Don’t let me --

let me split and splinter, like 

an earthquake fissure, all break and no bone. 

 

Don’t let --

let me stop you from smoothing all the 

coarse and cracked curves of me. 

 

Don’t, 

don’t let me be.
