title: Fly in the Wine
---

- He doesn’t believe me
- but a fly in the wine changes it:
- the smell, the taste -- of course, the allure.
- Air-lifting it out doesn’t help either.
- ~
- He doesn’t believe me, but I don’t care.
- I drain and refill anyway, which makes him shake his head;
- makes him question my dedication to sustainability;
- makes him panic. At worst -- blame.
- ~
- This makes me feel resilient -- this fresh pour;
- makes me feel sweet and unbent, translucent and lucid;
- makes me think that a mile away, a drunk fly,
- and a sad sigh are maybe all the same.
