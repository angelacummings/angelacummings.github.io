title: Pluto
---

- Pluto, you are out. Just like that.
- Heartless.
^
- As if none of us could relate to you—
  - not quite big enough for our own britches,
  - not pulling all of our own weight.
- You are not a survivor of this reality show.
- And now, the pejoratives:
- “dwarf,” “outcast,” the embarrassing “planette.”
- You need some savvy P.R., Pluto—
  - an interview with Diane Sawyer,
  - a good turn on “Dancing with the Stars.”
- Children all over earth pluck
- your tiny likeness from their mobiles.
- I have to wonder: will plutonium seek a new sponsor?
- Who will bat ninth for the galaxy?
- Must you be known as only a mousey mouse’s dog?
- Unsavory.
^
- Still, you glide on, if awkwardly, if slowly.
- It is dark out there. Mercury is nervous.
