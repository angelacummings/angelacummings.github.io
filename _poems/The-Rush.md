title: The Rush

---

- Here comes the rush of the morning:
- the cold harbor breathes out, and
- its current does not waver. No.
- It knows exactly where it is going.

- ~
- Here comes the rush of the hour:
- the bold, needle-less limbs of the fir tree
- welcoming all guests; its deep, dark
- hostels uniting migrants and natives alike.
- Note: this tree is not really a fir.
- No one minds.

- ~
- And here comes the rush of the minute:
- configurations of worlds climbing over
- the peaks of my eye's vista,
- dancing in gravity's ancient ballroom;
- cuddling together for a moment --
- a moment that is over too soon.  And I?
- I, for once, am not in a hurry to do anything.
